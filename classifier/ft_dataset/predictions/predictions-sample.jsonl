Made strong enough for outdoor residential and institutional play.Sports legend has it that the height of that first basketball goal was 10', setting the standard that is used even today.

Measuring for the correct regulation basketball goal height is straightforward: the top of the rim should be set 10' above the playing surface. The 10' rim height measurement should not be confused with the top of the backboard or the bottom of the net. First Team offers backboards in a variety of sizes, from 30 x 44 up to traditional competition size 48 x 72 tempered glass. Whatever the size of the backboard, the rim is set at the same regulation height.The official height of a regulation basketball hoop is 10 feet, measured from the top edge of the rim to the floor. This rim height is used by the National Basketball Association, the Women's National Basketball Association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, most high schools and Olympic basketball."}

To calculate: Just add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.The mean is the average you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order, so you may have to rewrite your list first.1 The median of a set of numbers is the number in the middle. 2  For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 3  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle. 4  If there are an even number of numbers, then the median is the average of the last 2 middle numbers.For a data set, the terms arithmetic mean, mathematical expectation, and sometimes average are used synonymously to refer to a central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values.The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated central value of a set of numbers."}
